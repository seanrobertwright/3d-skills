"""
Deterministic half of the pr-trajectory-audit skill. Pure stdlib -- no framework,
no API key, no network calls beyond `gh` (which the user already has authenticated
if they're using GitHub at all). This is the "cheapest check first" tier: everything
in this file runs in milliseconds and costs zero LLM tokens.

Three subcommands:

  mine <owner/repo> [--limit N] [--window-days D] [--similarity T] [--out path.json]
      Pulls the repo's PR history via `gh pr list` (one bulk call, full body text
      included) and runs two passes over it:
        Pass 1 -- title back-references ("...(#N)" at the end of a title). Cheap,
                  high precision, LOW RECALL. Try this first and you'll usually
                  conclude a repo has almost no interesting failure chains. That
                  conclusion is usually wrong -- see Pass 2.
        Pass 2 -- body cross-references (fixes/closes/resolves/follow-up to/
                  regression from/reverts # N). This is where the real signal
                  lives. A PR referenced 2+ times by LATER PRs is a PR that needed
                  revisiting -- the "this failure mode recurred" signal.
      Also runs a duplicate-cluster detector: PRs opened within a short window of
      each other with high title-text similarity (stdlib difflib, no embeddings) --
      a coordination-failure signal (independent runs re-fixing the same thing),
      not a logic-bug signal.

  checks <owner/repo> <pr_number> [--window-days D] [--similarity T] [--json]
      Runs the scope blast-radius check plus a duplicate-vs-recent-PRs check on
      ONE PR, at open time -- not retrospectively. Prints structured findings
      (evidence), posts nothing. This is what the live-review workflow (Workflow B)
      calls before handing off to Claude's own Tier 2 judgment.

  scope [-] [--title T] [--files F] [--count N]
      Reads a single PR's {title, files, changedFiles} -- either as JSON piped in
      from `gh pr view <n> --json title,files,changedFiles` (pass "-") or via flags
      -- and applies a scope blast-radius heuristic: does a narrowly-titled
      "fix(module):" PR touch infra/config files or an unusually large file count
      that has no business being in that diff? Zero LLM calls. This is Tier 1, not
      Tier 2 -- it catches a real, cheap signal that a diff may not match its claim,
      *before* spending a judgment call on the actual diff content.

All three subcommands are deliberately simple heuristics, not proofs. They exist
to cheaply narrow "hundreds and hundreds of PRs" down to a handful worth a real
look -- see references/judging-rubric.md for what to do with what they flag.
